# Delinquency Prediction EDA Project

This project explores customer loan data to identify high-risk factors contributing to delinquency.  
It includes data cleaning, missing value handling, risk indicator discovery, feature engineering, and final recommendations for predictive modeling.

## Files Included
- `Delinquency_EDA_Notebook.ipynb`: Full EDA notebook with visualizations and insights.
- `Delinquency_prediction_dataset.xlsx`: The dataset analyzed (sample, masked).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries needed.

## Key Highlights
- Thorough missing value analysis and handling strategies.
- Detection of high-risk indicators (High Credit Utilization, High DTI, Low Credit Score, etc.)
- Creation of binary risk flags for modeling improvement.
- Clean visualizations: histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps.

## Next Steps
- Build baseline machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore SHAP values for model interpretability.
